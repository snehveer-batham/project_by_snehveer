**Problem Statement:**
As employers and educators, it is essential to comprehend the career aspirations of Gen Z as they enter the workforce with distinct values, expectations, and goals. Understanding their career aspirations is crucial for effectively supporting and engaging with this emerging talent pool. Our project aims to illuminate their career aspirations and provide valuable insights through advanced Excel, SQL, and Power BI dashboards.

**Recommended Analysis:**
We conducted primary research to gather data and enhance customer experience for overall business growth. For our Gen Z-focused problem statement, we collected 3100 forms on platforms like LinkedIn and Instagram, totaling 50,000 responses from diverse postal codes in India. Using MySQL Server Workbench, we imported and analyzed data, addressing 22 business inquiries across four tables. Subsequently, we imported the data into Power BI, creating two dashboards: a comprehensive overview and a focused area dashboard covering Gen Z's learning, mission, and manager aspirations.
